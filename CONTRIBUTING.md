## Commit Message Guidelines

Please follow the **conventional commits** format:

``type: short description``

Example:
``
feat: add navbar component
fix: correct typo in footer
``


Valid types include:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones
- `chore`: Other changes that donâ€™t modify `src` or `test` files

---

## Code Style

- Use consistent formatting with Prettier or your teamâ€™s formatting rules.
- Keep functions and components concise and well-documented.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

---

## Opening a Pull Request

Please ensure that your pull request includes:

- A clear description of what the change does
- Reference to any related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`)
- Relevant tests or documentation updates (if applicable)
